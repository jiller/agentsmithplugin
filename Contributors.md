I appreciate very much help of
  * **Vladimir Smolyaninov**, who ported Agent Smith for ReSharper 4.0 and performed optimizations of spell checking engine.
  * **ERT Team**, especially Valentin Shtronda and Alex Dryga, who were the first users of the plugin and had very good suggestions (well, the name Agent Smith in particular I owe to them :)).
  * **Dimitry Fayerman**, who fixed a number of issues with XML comments.
  * Many people who like the plugin and have helped in many other ways.
